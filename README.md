# Pokemon!
This project is was aimed to get children involved in project development on GIT. This project will include several scenarios and data structures that children can us to build thier very own Pokemon web application. The great thisn about it is that it will give the skills an confidence to make additions and customizations to thier very own project. 

## Why Pokemon?
The question I ask is why not? Rather than have these young people plow through a dusty book or one that slogs throuhg only the very basics. We will aim to cover the important points in programming while engaging something that they can relate to. Besides who doesn't like pikachu.
